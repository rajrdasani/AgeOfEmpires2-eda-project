Hypothesis:
AOE2 is most popularly played in the US 

```{r}
aoe2 %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(avggames = mean(games), avgwins = mean(wins), avglosses = mean(losses), avgdrops = mean(drops)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avggames))


aoe2 %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

pop_countries_count <- aoe2 %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  subset(count > 100) 

pop_countries_v <- pop_countries_count$country

pop_countries <- aoe2[aoe2$country %in% pop_countries_v, ]
